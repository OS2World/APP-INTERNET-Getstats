Description:

        *getstats* (formerly called "getsites") is a C program that
will produce detailed, concise, monthly, weekly, daily summary, daily,
hourly summary, hourly, domain, request, directory tree, and error
reports from your World-Wide Web or Gopher server.

Here's the details:

        * Works with CERN, NCSA, Plexus, GN, MacHTTP,
          and UNIX Gopher log files.
        * Supports the "common" Web log format.
        * All reports are in the same consistent format.
        * Basic statistics include server name and type, date,
          total requests last 7 days, unique hosts last 7 days,
          total unique hosts, number of HTML, script, and non-HTML requests,
          total number of requests, average load (requests per hour and day),
          number of bad requests, date coverage, and running time.
        * Detailed report includes host name, number of host requests,
          and last access date.
        * Monthly, weekly, daily, hourly, and summary reports are in vertical
          bar-chart format, with number of requests for each week or day.
        * You can add byte traffic statistics to every report.
        * Full, request, and domain reports can be sorted by requests,
          name, byte traffic, or date.
        * You can filter requests and IP or name addresses matching
          certain conditions. You can filter by date, hour and day
          conditions also.
        * You can generate "Top 10 (or any number)" lists.
        * getstats can take standard input, so you can pipe stuff to it.
        * getstats can produce HTML output.
        * Runs under VMS, DEC Ultrix, SunOS...
